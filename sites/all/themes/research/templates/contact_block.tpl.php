    <h3>Working at Collaborative</h3>
    <p>
        Collaborative hires staff that the team has previously worked with in a research capacity; with over 40 years of
        combined industry experience, we have a large stable of excellent researchers whose work we can vouch for, and from
        which we draw additional staff as needed.  In addition to research capability, it is imperative that the candidate is
        a good personality fit within the company and will work optimally with other team members.
        A high quality of work, excellent client service, and an above-average level of staff retention are key goals for our
        company, and we believe that these can only be fully realized by giving good salaries, consistent profit sharing,
        a generous approach to personal time needed, and supporting professional development via training investment,
        so this is how we incentivize our team.
        <br/>
